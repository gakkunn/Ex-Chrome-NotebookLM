# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-12-07

This Privacy Policy applies to the Chrome extension "NotebookLM Shortcut Effective Extension" (the "Extension").

## 1. Information We Collect

The Extension does not transmit or store any personal information or usage data on servers controlled by the developer.

Some settings or temporary data may be stored locally in your browser (for example, using Chrome’s storage features) to keep feature toggles and custom shortcut bindings. This data remains on your device and is used only to adjust the behavior of the extension on `notebooklm.google.com`. It is not sent to any external servers.

## 2. Sharing with Third Parties

The Extension does not provide data to third parties and does not collect information for tracking, analytics, or advertising purposes.

## 3. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
If we make important changes, we will announce them via the extension’s store page, release notes, or other appropriate means.
