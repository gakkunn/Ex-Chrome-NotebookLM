# NotebookLM Shortcut Effective Extension

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

## Overview

A Chrome extension that boosts NotebookLM input and navigation with shortcuts, prevents accidental sends, and adjusts the layout. You can toggle each feature and customize key bindings from the popup.

This is an open-source extension implemented based on Chrome Extension Manifest v3.

## Features

- Safe Send: Enter inserts a newline; Cmd/Ctrl + Enter sends (toggleable)
- Vim-like Scroll: j / k / Shift+j / Shift+k / Cmd/Ctrl + j/k to scroll or jump to top/bottom
- Wide Screen & Omnibar Toggle: Shift+Space switches focus/visibility to free up a wider workspace
- Workflow Shortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts to open the Sources tab and click "Add source," clear chat history (wide view), show/hide sidebars, and switch tabs in small view
- Shortcut Help & Customization: Edit shortcuts in the popup; press Cmd/Ctrl + / to show the in-page help modal
